# Coding Quiz

## Description 

This coding quiz was created because as a bootcamp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores (eventually - coming soon!) so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

I learned a lot through this challenge. I was given solution code that I did not understand and ultimately made the decision to completely delete it and start from scratch. I comment almost every piece of code in JavaScript so I could understand each piece and how everything worked together. I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish. 

Some of the code I learned a lot about was creating a start button to trigger a timer to start. I was able to loop through questions where the user could pick and answer and recieve feedback on whether or not is was correct as it moved on to the question. I was able to manipulate the timer if the answer was incorrect and dock the time. I also learned how to created a function to track the score.
